# Authentication Bypass

## Username Enumeration

A helpful exercise to complete when trying to find authentication vulnerabilities is creating a list of valid usernames, which we'll use later in other tasks.

Website error messages are great resources for collating this information to build our list of valid usernames.

```bash
user@tryhackme$ ffuf -w /usr/share/wordlists/SecLists/Usernames/Names/names.txt -X POST -d "username=FUZZ&email=x&password=x&cpassword=x" -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" -u http://10.201.37.142/customers/signup -mr "username already exists"
```

In the above example, the -w argument selects the file's location on the computer that contains the list of usernames that we're going to check exists. The -X argument specifies the request method, this will be a GET request by default, but it is a POST request in our example. The -d argument specifies the data that we are going to send. In our example, we have the fields username, email, password and cpassword. We've set the value of the username to FUZZ. In the ffuf tool, the FUZZ keyword signifies where the contents from our wordlist will be inserted in the request. The -H argument is used for adding additional headers to the request. In this instance, we're setting the Content-Type so the web server knows we are sending form data. The -u argument specifies the URL we are making the request to, and finally, the -mr argument is the text on the page we are looking for to validate we've found a valid username.

## Brute Force

A brute force attack is an automated process that tries a list of commonly used passwords against either a single username or, like in our case, a list of usernames.

```bash

user@tryhackme$ ffuf -w valid_usernames.txt:W1,/usr/share/wordlists/SecLists/Passwords/Common-Credentials/10-million-password-list-top-100.txt:W2 -X POST -d "username=W1&password=W2" -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" -u http://10.201.37.142/customers/login -fc 200

```

## Logic Flaw

Sometimes authentication processes contain logic flaws. A logic flaw is when the typical logical path of an application is either bypassed, circumvented or manipulated by a hacker. Logic flaws can exist in any area of a website, but we're going to concentrate on examples relating to authentication in this instance.
